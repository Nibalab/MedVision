### MedVision is built using the following technologies:

- The backend is powered by [Laravel 11](https://laravel.com/), a PHP framework used to handle authentication, database management, and server-side logic.
- The frontend is developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is used for implementing real-time chat functionality using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), enabling seamless communication between doctors and patients.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is utilized for authentication and session management, ensuring secure access for users.
- The database is managed using [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/), providing reliable storage for patient and doctor information, reports, and appointments.
- Machine learning models are used to analyze CT scans uploaded by doctors to detect the presence of cancer, enabling advanced diagnostic capabilities.
- The live chat functionality between doctors and patients, as well as between doctors, is powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for real-time communication.

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<img src="./readme/title7.svg"/>

###  Mastering AI Interaction: Unveiling the Power of Prompt Engineering:


- This project leverages advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize interaction with deep learning models for cancer detection. The system uses a pre-trained [VGG16](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vgg-16-cnn-model/) model to analyze CT scan images and predict the likelihood of cancer. By carefully crafting the input data (in this case, images in base64 format), the system ensures that the model receives appropriately preprocessed data for accurate predictions.

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is utilized to load and run the pre-trained model, while [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) serves as the backend API for handling incoming image data and returning predictions. Additionally, [Flask-CORS](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Cors/) is integrated to ensure seamless cross-origin communication between the frontend and backend.

- The cancer detection model processes CT scan images, classifies them, and returns a result indicating whether cancer is present. The model operates in real-time through a web-based API, providing fast and reliable diagnostic results to assist doctors in decision-making.

- By using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server to the internet, the system enables remote access to the prediction API, allowing users to submit images from anywhere for analysis. The modelâ€™s predictions are efficiently interpreted to determine whether the result is "Cancer" or "No Cancer."

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) power the real-time live chat feature, enabling seamless communication between doctors and patients or between doctors themselves. The prompts within the chat are designed to maintain fluid and meaningful conversations, ensuring that both patients and doctors receive accurate and context-aware responses.

<!-- AWS Deployment -->
<img src="./readme/title8.svg"/>

###  Efficient AI Deployment: Unleashing the Potential with AWS Integration:

- The frontend of this project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring high-performance delivery of the React application. Vercel provides automatic build and deployment pipelines directly from the GitHub repository, enabling fast and reliable updates for the user interface.

- The backend is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, utilizing the scalability and flexibility of Amazon's cloud infrastructure. This instance hosts the Laravel-based API and machine learning model services, ensuring seamless processing of CT scan image data and returning predictions in real time.

<!-- Unit Testing -->
<img src="./readme/title9.svg"/>

###  Precision in Development: Harnessing the Power of Unit Testing:

- While unit tests ensure the internal correctness of the system, Postman is used to manually test and validate API endpoints during development. By sending requests and reviewing the responses, we ensure that the Laravel backend API handles authentication, data retrieval, and communication processes correctly.

- Postman helps verify the accuracy of key endpoints, including those handling CT scan image uploads, cancer predictions, report generation, and appointment management. It also ensures that Socket.IO-based communication for real-time chat functions as intended.

- This manual testing method is particularly useful for checking the integration between the frontend and backend, making sure that responses match expected behavior under different conditions before deploying to production.
